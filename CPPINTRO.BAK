  Programming (An approach to write a program)


  Program - Solution ( Product )

  OOP is a theoratical concept to understand the real life in computer world with technical description.

  OOP - How to create new objects and how to use existing one (object base)

  Paradigms

  Class   - Class is collection of descriptions. It is just an imagination.
	    It does not physically exist in the world.
  Object  - Physically exist in the word which can be describe

  Relation Between Class and Object

  Class gives theoratical description about an object and object is real life
  representative of class. It tells what what of an object is.

  Ecapsulation - It is a process to wrap the information about an object which
  you want to create into a single unit after encasulation the encapsulated unit
  is know as class. Class has

	Properties  - Decide how an object look like
	Function - decide how an object work
	Events  - what kind of actions an object can take.
	Event Handlers - when a function associated with an event that function is known as event handler

  in its description. During encpsulation we will also decide which one member of class
  should be public or private to make a member private is known as data hiding.

  class classname
  {
    private:
      .....  variables
      -----  function
    public:
      ......... vars
      --------- fun
  };

  // Private and Public known as access specifiers
  //Which one memeber will be accessed outside the class or which one not

  Abstration - represent the complexity in simple manner

  Inheritance
